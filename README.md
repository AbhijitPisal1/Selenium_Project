## Repository Overview

This repository serves as a hands-on guide for learning **Java**, **Selenium**, and **TestNG**. It includes basic Java concepts, sample interview questions, real-world OOP projects, and multiple test scripts using Selenium for web automation. Additionally, it provides useful configurations for test setups and parallel execution with TestNG.

## Technologies Used

- **Java 8+** (Required for running the repository)
- **Selenium** (WebDriver for browser automation)
- **TestNG** (Testing framework for running tests)
- **Maven** (For dependency management and build automation)

## Installation Instructions

To get started with this repository on your local machine, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites:
1. **Java 8+**: Make sure you have Java 8 or above installed on your system.
2. **Maven**: You need **Maven** installed to manage dependencies and build the project.
3. **IDE**: Use **Eclipse**, **IntelliJ IDEA**, or **NetBeans** for the development environment.

### Steps to Clone and Set Up:
```plaintext
1. **Clone the repository**:
   git clone https://github.com/AbhijitPisal1/Selenium_Project.git
   cd Java-Test-Automation
2. Install dependencies with Maven:
   mvn clean install
3. Run the tests using Maven:
   mvn test
```

This will install all necessary dependencies and run your tests using the configurations provided.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders to help you learn and practice various aspects of Java, Selenium, and Test Automation.

### Java Basics
Contains foundational Java concepts such as data types, control structures, and collections. It provides simple examples for understanding core Java features.

### Interview Preparation
Houses sample interview questions and answers focused on Java, arrays, strings, maps, and more. Ideal for preparing for Java-related interviews.

### OOP Basics
Explains Object-Oriented Programming concepts through real-life examples such as **Employee**, **Student**, and **Car**. It covers principles like inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

### Project
This folder contains several real-world projects to demonstrate practical applications of OOP principles in Java. Some example projects include:
- **Banking System**
- **Employee Management System**
- **Hotel Reservation System**
- **Student Management System**

### Test Scripts
This folder contains various test scripts using **Selenium** and **TestNG**, such as:
- **Grid Test Scripts**: For running tests on Selenium Grid.
- **TestNG Grouped Test Scripts**: Demonstrating how to use groups in TestNG.
- **Parallel Test Scripts**: Shows how to run tests in parallel using TestNG.
- **TestNG Scripts**: A collection of different test scripts using various Selenium actions, methods, and scenarios.

### Resources
Contains essential resources for running and configuring tests:
- **configFiles**: Includes `config.properties` used for configuration in test scripts.
- **testdata**: Contains CSV files for data-driven testing with TestNG.
