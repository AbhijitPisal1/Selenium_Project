Inheritance

common code can be written in separate class and can be inherited in other classes.
 code reusability
- IS-A relationship
- Parent-child relation
- 'extends' keyword is used
- data member are available to child class
- one class can extend only one parent class
- one class can be parent of multiple classes
- same class cannot be parent of same class


### polymorphism ###

- Achieved by method overloading and method overriding
- No such concept for variables

Method Overloading
- many method with same name but different parameters in single class
- compiler decides which method to run based on values provided
- also known as "compile time Polymorphism" and "static Polymorphism"

Method Overriding
- done by inheritance
- same parent method with different implementation in child class
- static method cannnot be override
- also known as "run time polymorphism" and "Dynamic Polymorphism"


### Abstraction ###

- hide internal details of implementation function
- two ways - create abstract class and create Interface

Interface 
- blueprint of class
- defines functionality without implementation
- IS-A relationship
- all methods in interface have to implemented in child class
- class implements multiple interfaces
- all methods in interface are by default "public abstract"
- interface can have variable - by default it is public static final
- no constructor or object are created for interface
- static method can be created with implementation
